# 🔐 SQL Injection Testing with SQLmap

## 💡 Project Overview
This project demonstrates ethical SQL Injection testing using **SQLmap**, one of the most powerful open-source penetration testing tools. It is designed to simulate real-world injection attacks in a safe and controlled environment using **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** and to help students, developers, and security enthusiasts learn about common database vulnerabilities.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Automated detection of SQL Injection vulnerabilities
- ✅ Real-time exploitation via command-line or scripts
- ✅ Target: DVWA hosted on localhost using XAMPP or Docker
- ✅ Parameterized testing with GET, POST, Cookie, and Header injections
- ✅ Custom SQLmap automation with Python
- ✅ Educational and beginner-friendly setup

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **SQLmap** (for SQLi testing)
- **DVWA** (vulnerable testbed)
- **XAMPP / Docker** (for local web server and MySQL)
- **Python** (optional automation and reporting)
- **Browser DevTools / Postman** (for capturing requests)
